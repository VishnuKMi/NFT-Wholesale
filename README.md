# NFT-Wholesale

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

npx hardhat help

npx hardhat test

REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test

npx hardhat node

npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
